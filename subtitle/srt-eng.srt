1
00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:04.992
So like many great things in life,

2
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.403
this project also starts with a cube.

3
00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:14.840
Just because I'm an old-fashioned person.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.240
I started using Blender when there was no Sculpting,

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.841
there was only Box and Poly by Poly Modeling.

6
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.753
What you see me doing here was essentially just adding

7
00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:33.145
Mirror and a Subsurf Modifier, and I got a little bit used

8
00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:39.000
to the Pie Menu editor. Ian was raving about it in the Studio,

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.720
I thought, maybe I'll try

10
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.720
to integrate it into my workflow. So what you saw there was

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.694
merely just a Pie Menu I made,

12
00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.152
to make it easier for me to add a Mirror Modifier and a Subsurf Modifier,

13
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:57.512
and I hooked it up to the Q key and that was it.

14
00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:00.960
Nothing really fancy and you don't have to use

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.720
these kind of Addons to make your workflow faster.

16
00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.491
I just wanted to try and see how that works.

17
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.918
Now in the beginning, nothing fancy is happening.

18
00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:24.480
A lot of the tools you see me using here are

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.147
fairly commonplace. I'm extruding, pressing down E,

20
00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:33.149
I'm sliding Edge Loops by double pressing G,

21
00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:38.055
every once in a while, I'm adding a new Edge Loop with Ctrl R.

22
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.240
Those keys might also vary on your configuration,

23
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.120
but that's essentially what I'm using currently to block out the shape.

24
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.000
I knew in the beginning that I just wanted

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.637
to start this rough with a boxy model

26
00:01:54.662 --> 00:02:01.000
that can be easily extended. I really didn't have any clear idea

27
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.132
how in detail this fish is going to look like.

28
00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:10.542
I had a lot of references from nature, and I knew

29
00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:16.240
I wanted to follow them loosely, because,

30
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.656
nature's amazing and everything.

31
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:24.120
But for the composition of this image, I have to take

32
00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:28.908
a lot of artistic license as well.

33
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:33.274
So I tried to be true to the overall feeling, the overall form

34
00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:38.095
of this amazing creature, but then, like the details,

35
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.240
are totally made up.

36
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:50.752
Now, I'm trying to get the proportions right.

37
00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:55.061
This is probably the most frustrating part.

38
00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:58.993
Because you're not doing anything glamorous right now,

39
00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:03.396
your model essentially looks like garbage.

40
00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:08.039
You just have to have faith, that in the end,

41
00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:11.100
you might be able to come up with something

42
00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.493
that's interesting to look at.

43
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.480
I'm just making a copy of the general model here.

44
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.913
Because, next, I'll straight away dive into Sculpt Mode

45
00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:27.840
with Dynamic Topology,

46
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.810
just draw this base mesh. I'm making a copy,

47
00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:36.240
and name everything in the Outliner.

48
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.652
With that copied, I apply all the Modifiers,

49
00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:44.080
then I'll use straight sculpting on the raw polygons.

50
00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:54.357
I also switch to the new sculpting workspace,

51
00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:56.954
which is really awesome to have

52
00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:02.598
these kind of new more defined work spaces.

53
00:04:02.623 --> 00:04:08.398
Because you could customize your workflow in Blender,

54
00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:12.558
but it's also good to have a common starting ground,

55
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.095
especially when you're trying

56
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.305
to communicate ideas to other people, see how they use Blender.

57
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.809
So I'm just starting with the rough Sculpting Work Space.

58
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.221
And then, over the course of this project,

59
00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:32.600
I tried to adjust to its workflow,

60
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.120
and also customize it, so it's not going to stay like that.

61
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.720
The Mattcap is also not going to stay,

62
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.277
and that's just part of the process for me.

63
00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:56.483
So I'm alternating between Draw Brush

64
00:04:56.508 --> 00:05:01.480
using Ctrl to pinch the model in, and the Clay Strip Brush.

65
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.955
Then every once in a while,

66
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.427
I'll use the Crease Brush to indicate some wrinkles.

67
00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:12.627
But this process right now is still fairly loose.

68
00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:15.000
Like I have a rough idea

69
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.720
of how this is going to turn out, but how to get there, I'm not really sure.

70
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.319
I'm also not really a sculpting artist.

71
00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:28.655
So a lot of the practices you see me using here,

72
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.045
if you're a seasoned sculptor, you might laugh at me.

73
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.720
But this is just about me trying trying out

74
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.480
some shapes and some forms. Then hopefully,

75
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.680
I'll try to make this look into something

76
00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:46.600
that's more presentable at the end.

77
00:06:05.362 --> 00:06:10.384
So all very very rough blocking here. The detail and Dynamic Topology

78
00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.915
is also not very big currently.

79
00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:18.433
Sooner or later, we'll start

80
00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:23.209
to retopologize this mesh.

81
00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:26.441
So it's not going to matter anyway.

82
00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:31.971
For me, now, it's just about blocking out the big overall shapes.

83
00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:35.930
Then later when we retopologize, we have a clean topology,

84
00:06:35.955 --> 00:06:40.705
we'll use the Multiresolution Modifier,

85
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.646
and then actually worry about all the details,

86
00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:50.960
all the skin creases, all the scales and fins.

87
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.080
So I'm adding a lot of material at once here,

88
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.720
very generous with the Clay Strips Brush.

89
00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:43.094
I wanted to get the right feeling for the mouth of this fish,

90
00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:49.799
mostly 80 to 70% mouth,

91
00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:53.611
and I added that little bit of crease there on the lip,

92
00:07:53.636 --> 00:07:55.448
like right there in the middle,

93
00:07:55.473 --> 00:08:01.898
which makes it more like a carp. Later, you see me removing that.

94
00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:04.480
It was really important for me

95
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.080
to get the mouth correctly.

96
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.542
At least, believable, for this kind of character.

97
00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:21.480
Another important thing is also the ratio versus eyes and face.

98
00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:23.865
So how big are the eyes going to be?

99
00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:29.391
This fish has been popularized quite a bit with Finding Nemo.

100
00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:33.240
In that film,

101
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.510
it's probably a she because

102
00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:38.080
females are bigger than the males.

103
00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:43.832
So the eyes in that film were just huge.

104
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.608
I wanted to get something a little bit more,

105
00:08:47.633 --> 00:08:51.554
like scary on a different level, not alien scary,

106
00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:55.131
but make the eyes small,

107
00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:59.290
make it more like a primal thing,

108
00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:04.428
not like it could be an intelligent things.

109
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.360
That huge blob there in the front aren't

110
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.935
really supposed to be the eyes.

111
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.533
That's more the eye socket.

112
00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:22.960
The iris probably going to be this little dot there.

113
00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:36.000
Now I am just lowering the details size.

114
00:09:37.095 --> 00:09:38.921
It's not adding about detail,

115
00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:43.820
but I get a bit fed Up with all the polygons here.

116
00:09:43.845 --> 00:09:48.080
If you just block out stuff,

117
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.935
you shouldn't worry about seeing polygons, and that kind of stuff,

118
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.080
because it's about the overall shape.

119
00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.240
Like said, maybe I also went too quickly

120
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.402
into more detail here. But sometimes I think you need

121
00:10:04.427 --> 00:10:06.840
that kind of inspiration when you're working on something,

122
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.120
especially with this project. I mean,

123
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.993
it's supposed to be more of a fun thing.

124
00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:20.360
Because I spent more than a year on the Spring open movie currently,

125
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.620
I was just doing one thing, which is lighting,

126
00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:27.974
and then managing other people. That's fun,

127
00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:32.080
but I was also missing the immediacy of something like this,

128
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.000
where you just go in and then just bash something out

129
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.080
in a matter of days.

130
00:10:45.414 --> 00:10:48.738
So here, I am with the Crease brush.

131
00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:50.631
That way,

132
00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:58.364
I can define the overall flow of the body shape,

133
00:11:00.257 --> 00:11:06.459
because those creases add some dynamics to the body.

134
00:11:06.484 --> 00:11:11.400
Of course, they should also not be too unbelievable.

135
00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:15.240
They should follow the overall skin texture,

136
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.789
the overall skin alignment, so it's not too much out of place.

137
00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:25.418
This whole project is about lines,

138
00:11:35.657 --> 00:11:39.500
and it's about dynamic flow of lines.

139
00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:43.398
And that was really important,

140
00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:45.989
while I was coming up with this character.

141
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:06.000
A big part of this was also, for me, some restrain,

142
00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:09.480
because as said, I'm not a seasoned sculptor.

143
00:12:11.095 --> 00:12:13.975
People like Julian here in the Studio,

144
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.954
they sculpt almost every day and they have their workflow,

145
00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.877
and they're accustomed to everything.

146
00:12:25.072 --> 00:12:28.530
I'm a total noob at this.

147
00:12:29.403 --> 00:12:33.480
For someone like me, it's very easy to get carried away

148
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.441
with too much detail. And also it's very easy

149
00:12:37.466 --> 00:12:44.992
to introduce unbelievable shapes into my models.

150
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.720
You might get carried away with the Blob Brush.

151
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.480
This makes a little nice blobby thing here

152
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.311
let's try more of that.

153
00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:57.120
At the end of the day, you notice that

154
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.480
looks like a potato. Whereas someone

155
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.401
who's used to a workflow like this,

156
00:13:03.426 --> 00:13:05.720
they do everything with purpose, of course.

157
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.032
So a big part of this, for me, at this point of the project,

158
00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:14.186
is trying to hold myself back,

159
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:19.050
not going all the way with wrinkle detail.

160
00:13:19.075 --> 00:13:25.354
I'm just trying to make it organic and believable, and hopefully

161
00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:30.048
I'll end up with something that looks aesthetically pleasing to me also.

162
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.683
I'm adding more wrinkle detail in currently.

163
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:29.361
That's because I'm trying to find the topology of the skin.

164
00:14:29.386 --> 00:14:32.611
Also I knew,

165
00:14:33.465 --> 00:14:36.761
if you check out nature documentary footage,

166
00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:41.702
these types of fish have lots of these tendrils on their bodies.

167
00:14:41.727 --> 00:14:45.091
So I wanted to make sure

168
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.360
that they sit on the skin correctly.

169
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.480
I'm indicating, at this point, a lot of blobs.

170
00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.377
Later, I hope

171
00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:04.317
I can add some of these tendrils to those blobs.

172
00:15:04.342 --> 00:15:10.893
So there's a nice flow and continuation.

173
00:15:30.787 --> 00:15:35.360
It's also really interesting how saggy their skin is.

174
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.240
It's not so much, if you look at reference footage,

175
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.240
it's not so much scaly. Actually,

176
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.000
it's more like a saggy lump of of cloth that's floating around in the water.

177
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.480
It's super fascinating.

178
00:15:52.397 --> 00:15:56.388
It seems almost like, especially at skeletons,

179
00:15:56.413 --> 00:16:00.360
the skin is just hanging loosely on their skeletons.

180
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.840
That's what I wanted to try and sell here.

181
00:16:04.686 --> 00:16:09.242
Also, those humps in the back is where the fins are going to extend.

182
00:16:09.267 --> 00:16:16.722
Later, I'm going to add curves to control those fins directly.

183
00:16:16.747 --> 00:16:19.387
Because doing that kind of detail in Sculpting

184
00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.473
is a little bit finicky.

185
00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:23.960
In the end, it ends up looking not pleasant.

186
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.000
So that's what

187
00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:30.542
I'm trying to achieve here.

188
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.350
Here, adding a cone for the teeth.

189
00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.600
The teeth are fairly simple.

190
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.334
I don't know why I added more detail to them.

191
00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:50.342
I could have just broken up a few to make it a bit more gnarly.

192
00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:54.335
But what I started out with, was a subdivided cone,

193
00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:01.351
and I Link Duplicated that cone

194
00:17:01.376 --> 00:17:04.975
all across the face

195
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.720
to add teeth everywhere. The only variation in those teeth

196
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.100
comes from scaling them on various axis.

197
00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:19.480
So I often just scale around local X axis,

198
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.960
or the local Z axis, to misalign them.

199
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.480
Here, I'm adding a single Mirror Modifier after the Subsurf to each tooth.

200
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:35.000
I'm using the base body mesh

201
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.240
as the mirror center object. That way,

202
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.176
I can really quickly block out the shapes, by all duplicating the teeth all over.

203
00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:47.562
And using Snapping to the faces

204
00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:52.253
and aligning my object to the underlying snap faces,

205
00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:55.851
I can really quickly block out the teeth.

206
00:18:24.011 --> 00:18:29.221
Again, currently, this is also an exercise of restrain for me,

207
00:18:30.445 --> 00:18:35.606
because this creature lends itself to adding teeth everywhere.

208
00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:37.720
You could go completely crazy

209
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.240
and make this as freaky as possible.

210
00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:45.401
Then again, I've done that in the past with other projects.

211
00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:46.720
With Creature Factory,

212
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.480
there's teeth everywhere.

213
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.144
That gets a little bit like a cliche for me.

214
00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:57.439
So keep it as restrained as possible

215
00:18:57.464 --> 00:19:00.550
and keep a logical alignment to the teeth, and not make them

216
00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:04.000
too crooked and too unrealistic.

217
00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:07.579
Of course, you're screaming at the screen right now,

218
00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:11.000
this is really unrealistic.

219
00:19:12.227 --> 00:19:16.643
Next time, I'll try to exercise more restrain.

220
00:19:16.668 --> 00:19:22.652
Hopefully I'll get something more believable done.

221
00:19:22.677 --> 00:19:24.502
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

222
00:19:39.718 --> 00:19:44.621
Next, the curves I talked about. So I'm adding

223
00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:48.087
a novel Bezier Curve, and I'm adding some depth to it,

224
00:19:48.112 --> 00:19:52.868
to give it some Extrusion. Then, I can shrink the tips down.

225
00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:57.240
That way, I can subdivide them

226
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.120
and the shrinkage will propagate through the subdivisions.

227
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:06.037
So I'm just shrinkening it, and fattening it,

228
00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:08.482
and then

229
00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:17.840
duplicating the curves all over.  Those curves are both going to be

230
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.840
these long tenderly appendages,

231
00:20:21.823 --> 00:20:26.896
but also serve as the basis for the fins,

232
00:20:26.921 --> 00:20:31.025
also on the back and on the tail end on the sides.

233
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.556
And later, the idea was that,

234
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.300
those curves are going to be integrated into my mesh.

235
00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:41.480
I'll keep the curves around,

236
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.080
later to make Retopology easier.

237
00:20:45.674 --> 00:20:50.960
But then later, I'll rig those and will pose them

238
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.675
in an interesting way, which hopefully fits

239
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.069
with the overall dynamic sense in this image.

240
00:21:01.591 --> 00:21:03.870
That sounds very artistic, I'm sorry.

241
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:16.106
There're also scale.

242
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:25.735
They had some points being moved on the X axis.

243
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.794
I just had to quickly scale them on the X axis down to 0,

244
00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:34.104
to make everything aligned on the mirror plane.

245
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:37.009
Because that's important,

246
00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:39.776
since later, on Retopology,

247
00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:42.840
we're going to to retopologize one side.

248
00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:47.901
I'm struggling a little bit with the reefs apology

249
00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:49.999
along the mirror axis, but

250
00:21:50.024 --> 00:21:52.720
that's just part of the deal for now.

251
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:59.463
The tail fin is going

252
00:21:59.488 --> 00:22:01.720
to have a little bit thicker lines,

253
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.840
thicker tendrils.

254
00:22:23.534 --> 00:22:27.845
I'm trying to find an interesting flow to them here.

255
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.314
The next thing is the fins on the side.

256
00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:36.600
I'll start out with a copy of the tail fin here,
seemed like a good thing to do.

257
00:22:59.665 --> 00:23:01.901
This is the biggest part.

258
00:23:01.926 --> 00:23:10.000
While the part that impacts the character the most,
the fishing lure of the fish,

259
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.794
I actually had some problems with this.

260
00:23:13.819 --> 00:23:18.273
Here, with curves, it's easy to give them

261
00:23:18.298 --> 00:23:25.634
an interesting dynamic shape, but I had to make this works.

262
00:23:25.659 --> 00:23:28.480
As said, this is only going

263
00:23:29.522 --> 00:23:35.309
to be the base of further sculpting adventures.

264
00:23:36.193 --> 00:23:38.720
If it looks rough right now, that's the idea.

265
00:23:48.653 --> 00:23:52.240
There's also some finy appendage on the chin.

266
00:23:52.575 --> 00:23:58.255
I'm not sure if that's anatomically correct,

267
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.321
but it seemed like a cool thing to do.

268
00:24:16.594 --> 00:24:19.681
And from the chin fin,

269
00:24:19.706 --> 00:24:25.243
I copied the entire object and then I added a Mirror Modifier to it.

270
00:24:25.268 --> 00:24:25.790
Because

271
00:24:33.569 --> 00:24:36.720
the fins on the Y axis,

272
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.678
are directly on the mirror line of this model,

273
00:24:39.703 --> 00:24:41.480
they don't need a Mirror Modifier.

274
00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:45.958
Whereas the fins on the side, they do.

275
00:24:46.772 --> 00:24:49.948
That's why I made a different object,

276
00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:54.000
really quick way of just organizing what gets mirrored,

277
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.833
and what not.

278
00:25:29.542 --> 00:25:33.125
We're starting to get more of an idea

279
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:39.123
of what this creature is going to look like.

280
00:25:39.148 --> 00:25:45.319
I thought, let's just add a little bit more of those tendrils.

281
00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:48.131
Because later, we can give them

282
00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:51.421
a little bit more interest by making them bioluminescent.

283
00:25:51.446 --> 00:25:56.362
That way, we can direct the viewers' attention much more.

284
00:25:56.387 --> 00:25:59.120
The tendrils

285
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.000
originate from the eyes of the fish are our great opportunity

286
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.423
to lure the viewers' attention towards the eye of the fish,

287
00:26:10.448 --> 00:26:13.600
because there are lines that point directly at it.

288
00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:17.935
Lines that point directly at things are very good in artworks,

289
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.721
because they help directing the viewers' eye to places

290
00:26:23.746 --> 00:26:25.470
where we want them to go.

291
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.432
But of course, those tendrils were a nightmare to retopologize.

292
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.801
Now back to the lure.

293
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.200
I have to realign this thing,

294
00:27:05.225 --> 00:27:09.925
because it would curve inwards and not outwards

295
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:17.000
if the fish was swimming ahead

296
00:27:17.834 --> 00:27:20.203
at a really fast pace, it would made sense

297
00:27:20.228 --> 00:27:24.695
to have this thing trailing off to the sides.

298
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.519
But I really wanted to curve it inwards.

299
00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:29.600
So later you'll see me realigning that thing.

300
00:27:30.408 --> 00:27:36.240
Now, I'm doing the actual skin flaps between the fins,

301
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.978
and those are just planes which have a Subsurf Modifier.

302
00:27:43.003 --> 00:27:50.062
And then I'm adding a little bit of solidify to those planes.

303
00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:52.499
What I'll do later is,

304
00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:59.175
I'll join everything together. So the curved fin, the curved tendril,

305
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.193
the lure, and all the other objects,

306
00:28:02.218 --> 00:28:06.014
are going to be turned into plane mesh objects.

307
00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:11.002
I'll join those to the main body and then further sculpt on it

308
00:28:11.027 --> 00:28:13.658
using Dynamic Topology. Later,

309
00:28:13.683 --> 00:28:17.960
I will do my best retopologizing it.

310
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.073
That was the quickest way to block out something really fast.

311
00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:49.120
This is the Solidifier with an offset of 0.

312
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.876
The mesh sits right in between the solid part.

313
00:28:53.901 --> 00:29:00.497
That way, I'm able to position the fins right on the mirror axis.

314
00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:07.552
And then the sharp parts are these creases.

315
00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:10.141
I'm not worrying about topology at this point,

316
00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:15.298
I just try to block everything out,

317
00:29:15.323 --> 00:29:18.701
and the creases are really a good way of doing that.

318
00:29:37.334 --> 00:29:40.611
And again, making a duplicate to another object.

319
00:29:40.636 --> 00:29:45.840
Because for the side fins, we're going to add a Mirror Modifier.

320
00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:07.336
I'm not worrying so much about the Retopology

321
00:30:08.323 --> 00:30:12.461
of the.....wait,

322
00:30:13.085 --> 00:30:16.120
that doesn't make any sense, cut that part out.

323
00:30:17.437 --> 00:30:23.088
Here I am positioning the solidified plane inside the fins.

324
00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:27.696
I'm using the Volume Snapping, and with this,

325
00:30:27.721 --> 00:30:33.720
I can precisely snap the vertices off the fins

326
00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:36.720
inside those tendrils here.

327
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.840
Of course, it always needs some realignment here.

328
00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:45.480
But that looks good.

329
00:30:48.107 --> 00:30:52.280
And later, when we join everything and when we smooth everything out,

330
00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:56.165
it's going to be one object anyway.

331
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:01.070
So we can smooth out the transition between the tendrils

332
00:31:01.095 --> 00:31:07.529
and the skin flaps of the fins.  It's going to seem more like

333
00:31:07.554 --> 00:31:10.066
it's made out of one thing.

334
00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:13.240
Currently, it's a bit hard to sell that idea.

335
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.840
That's the chin fin.

336
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.497
I should make up a better word for this kind of stuff.

337
00:31:53.314 --> 00:31:59.307
I'm just roughly making the fins a size I want.

338
00:31:59.332 --> 00:32:04.496
I just used GG, which is Edge Slide.

339
00:32:04.521 --> 00:32:07.840
The top fin looks a bit strange right now.

340
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.686
I'm trying to mix it with the body in a better way here.

341
00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:19.547
So it will just flow into the head and then into the tail fin.

342
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:42.588
Now that I have more information in detail on my model,

343
00:33:42.613 --> 00:33:44.270
I can go back to Sculpting.

344
00:33:44.295 --> 00:33:48.486
Later when we join everything, I can give it the final touches.

345
00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:53.168
As I said, Sculpting is not going to be the final step.

346
00:33:53.193 --> 00:33:56.921
I don't even dare to do detailing at this point.

347
00:33:56.946 --> 00:33:59.720
Because when you're detailing in Dynamic Topology,

348
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.095
you have to be very super fine detailed.

349
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.480
Otherwise, if you're baking a Displacement Map from that,

350
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.569
it gets tessellated.

351
00:34:09.594 --> 00:34:16.117
So I'm not a huge fan of baking Displacement Maps from Dynamic Topology meshes.

352
00:34:16.142 --> 00:34:21.646
That's why I decided to go

353
00:34:21.671 --> 00:34:24.065
with Multiresolution in the end.

354
00:34:25.177 --> 00:34:29.080
This is the said realignment of the lure.

355
00:34:32.626 --> 00:34:35.600
I'm also making it a little bit shorter.

356
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.840
Probably in practice in the end,

357
00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:45.276
it could be even shorter to make it easier

358
00:34:45.825 --> 00:34:50.240
for the final image composition. Because having a lot of

359
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.744
these tendrily objects in a frame can make it very busy.

360
00:34:55.769 --> 00:35:02.756
In the end, I had a really hard time managing all these lines.

361
00:35:05.341 --> 00:35:06.360
The eyes,

362
00:35:07.121 --> 00:35:10.494
just a simple sphere. I'm scaling down on one axis

363
00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:14.960
and then assigning a Mirror Modifier to it.

364
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.789
There's going to be some detailed modeling later.

365
00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.694
But this is fine for now,

366
00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:23.080
to give me more as a sense of the character,

367
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.240
also going to help sculpting the eye socket.

368
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:42.756
I'm trying a little bit of eyelids here.

369
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:46.985
But with fish, you really don't want to give them eyelids.

370
00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:53.676
Except when you're making an animated film with cute and cuddly fishes.

371
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:57.146
But if you want to make something look scary,

372
00:35:57.171 --> 00:35:58.361
you don't give it eyelids.

373
00:36:22.443 --> 00:36:24.480
Some troubles with Extrusion.

374
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.849
Now,

375
00:36:56.874 --> 00:37:04.414
we're pretty far into the overall proportions of this creature.

376
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:08.995
So I'll try to join everything together.

377
00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.891
I'm happy

378
00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:15.240
with the overall ratio of fins versus body, the face,

379
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:19.120
looks fine to me. I mean I could go on forever with this,

380
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.603
but there was also a limited time frame.

381
00:37:22.091 --> 00:37:27.012
Now I need to convert all the curves to meshes first.

382
00:37:27.037 --> 00:37:33.029
Then I have to apply the Modifiers of those skin flaps for the fins.

383
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:35.830
In order for that to happen,

384
00:37:35.878 --> 00:37:41.270
I need to organize myself a little bit better, and name things,

385
00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:46.096
and move everything to the proper collection.

386
00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:50.985
I use the Boo Tool Addon to Boolean things together, which is super handy.

387
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.796
It's one of the default Addons.

388
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:56.990
It's not enabled by default, but you can enable it,

389
00:37:57.015 --> 00:38:01.080
and it makes Booleaning things together, really quickly,

390
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.960
much faster.

391
00:38:04.546 --> 00:38:07.604
So I've joined the fins together and here

392
00:38:07.629 --> 00:38:11.771
I'm testing out if it's possible to do what I want with this.

393
00:38:11.796 --> 00:38:13.080
I had no clue.

394
00:38:13.903 --> 00:38:18.329
So I smooth out the transitions between the skin,

395
00:38:19.975 --> 00:38:24.195
the body, and the skin of the fins.

396
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:29.120
That helps thickening out the basis of the fins a little bit,

397
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.840
before I add more of those tendrils to it.

398
00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:40.120
Right now, this is pure exploration

399
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.000
to see if I can do what I want to do with this.

400
00:39:04.293 --> 00:39:08.240
Still just smoothing out, and next,

401
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.160
I'm adding the tendrils, the curves,

402
00:39:13.185 --> 00:39:20.643
and converting all the curves into Mesh Objects,

403
00:39:20.668 --> 00:39:22.240
seems like a good thing to do.

404
00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:26.785
The reason why I use curved for modeling and not straight meshes

405
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.013
is because

406
00:39:29.038 --> 00:39:34.960
you can vary the detail level as you're working on it more easily.

407
00:39:34.985 --> 00:39:39.009
Sometimes, of course, curves give you more problems,

408
00:39:39.034 --> 00:39:42.510
especially on the ends, because they're not joined together.

409
00:39:42.535 --> 00:39:44.768
So I just select

410
00:39:44.793 --> 00:39:50.641
all the open edges here, and I'm joining everything together.

411
00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:53.963
I have to be super careful at the ends

412
00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:58.709
to make sure the tips are all joined together.

413
00:39:58.734 --> 00:40:01.216
Because by default, Blender doesn't do that.

414
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:06.386
Even if you're shrinking down a curve to 0, it doesn't join something together.

415
00:40:06.411 --> 00:40:10.509
You have to do that manually at the end,

416
00:40:10.545 --> 00:40:12.091
that's what I'm doing here.

417
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.905
Of course, there's also a little bit of a shortcut to it.

418
00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.250
But I'll do that in the second run here.

419
00:40:21.404 --> 00:40:26.308
I also have to say I'm sorry that I customized my Merge menu.

420
00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:28.736
I actually turned it into a Pie Menu,

421
00:40:28.772 --> 00:40:30.479
which is just quickly,

422
00:40:32.048 --> 00:40:35.980
I just wrote myself an Addon, that's not a big deal.

423
00:40:36.005 --> 00:40:38.497
But I like it much better

424
00:40:38.522 --> 00:40:42.000
because you can flick into a certain direction

425
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.840
and emerge that way more intuitively.

426
00:40:46.949 --> 00:40:50.080
I did another tech check for

427
00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:52.851
Manifold Edges and Vertices,

428
00:40:53.977 --> 00:40:55.817
just to see if I missed anything.

429
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.545
Now the faster way to do this is,

430
00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:06.686
here, I'm turning the other tendrils into meshes.

431
00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:12.176
The faster way to do that is search for Manifolds right from the start,

432
00:41:12.201 --> 00:41:14.000
because then Blender will select them.

433
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.609
That's why I'm doing here.

434
00:41:17.634 --> 00:41:21.318
I'm searching for Selecting Non Manifolds, and then I press F.

435
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:28.119
Pressing F will just make faces, they're not really nice faces,

436
00:41:28.144 --> 00:41:29.815
they are Ngons.

437
00:41:31.334 --> 00:41:35.577
That doesn't really matter for the Boolean process.

438
00:41:37.282 --> 00:41:38.832
That way,

439
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.339
the tips and the bases of those tendrils are joined together.

440
00:41:46.364 --> 00:41:49.526
Then in the end, I did a Merge by Distance

441
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:54.971
which will finally fuse the tips together. Just to be sure.

442
00:41:54.996 --> 00:42:00.335
It helps to do something twice,

443
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.720
so just check if they actually happened.

444
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.360
Joining everything together.

445
00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:17.240
Just using Boolean Union and I'm actually joining everything together,

446
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.233
I'm not creating Boolean Modifiers.

447
00:42:20.258 --> 00:42:23.080
I'm stupidly and flatly bashing

448
00:42:23.747 --> 00:42:26.120
all the stuff together right now.

449
00:42:30.128 --> 00:42:34.056
Again, filling holes, making everything manifold,

450
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:37.240
and then joining everything together.

451
00:42:38.162 --> 00:42:42.215
Now, more fun, more sculpting fun can happen,

452
00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.840
because now I have a continuous mesh and I can make sure that

453
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.080
the tendrils fuse into the body in a nicer way.

454
00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:51.240
And of course,

455
00:42:52.147 --> 00:42:55.697
I was probably getting carried away too quickly,

456
00:42:55.722 --> 00:43:00.808
and I didn't pay attention to the Subdivision Level here,

457
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:05.472
because those created quite a lot of artifacts on the curves,

458
00:43:05.497 --> 00:43:07.676
or the tendrils, as I call them.

459
00:43:09.098 --> 00:43:11.305
For the next project, I'll just keep that in mind.

460
00:43:20.353 --> 00:43:23.427
I'm super quickly smoothing out things.

461
00:43:23.452 --> 00:43:28.410
I'm using the Blob Brush to add more volumes

462
00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:35.360
to those tendrils and those lures to make it more organic.

463
00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:39.960
These are some of the artifacts I talked about.

464
00:44:00.463 --> 00:44:04.035
Now, it's really just about making

465
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:09.840
the skin flaps of the fins feel a little bit more real,

466
00:44:10.759 --> 00:44:11.480
and

467
00:44:12.323 --> 00:44:16.120
less of straight lines.

468
00:44:17.095 --> 00:44:20.740
Again, another artifact. But those are going to go away

469
00:44:20.776 --> 00:44:22.491
once I do Retopology.

470
00:44:33.741 --> 00:44:37.480
While I'm sculpting, I found that it's a good practice

471
00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.000
to switch Mattcap every once in a while, to get a fresh eye on things.

472
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.360
That's what I'm doing here. Sometimes a Mattcap

473
00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.290
can give you interesting surface detail,

474
00:44:46.315 --> 00:44:50.240
that's more inspiring for you to work with.

475
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.815
Which is a good thing because on a project like this,

476
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.720
you work on it for a long time,

477
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.600
keep yourself inspired is very important.

478
00:45:00.625 --> 00:45:05.675
Especially if you're not working with a team. If you have colleagues,

479
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.124
or friends whom you can show the stuff,

480
00:45:08.149 --> 00:45:10.927
don't hesitate to do that.

481
00:45:10.952 --> 00:45:14.847
I got a lot of great help from people just dropping by my desk

482
00:45:14.872 --> 00:45:19.512
and giving me notes about this. Especially for the final image composition,

483
00:45:19.537 --> 00:45:23.360
I learned a lot of stuff, and I'm really happy that

484
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:29.001
I know work with people who you can just poke every day,

485
00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:32.406
and in the end, your artwork is going to look better.

486
00:45:40.659 --> 00:45:47.376
So the final run of merging the eyebrow tendrils,

487
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:54.264
would called them eyelashes, into the body. Those were a bit tricky,

488
00:45:54.289 --> 00:46:00.158
because I reposition them in the Sculpting process.

489
00:46:00.918 --> 00:46:05.335
That way I had some problems retopologizing them.

490
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.531
So I had to join the curves back

491
00:46:10.556 --> 00:46:15.080
to my retopologized mesh later on. Well, I'll mention that again

492
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.120
when I get to it.

493
00:46:30.803 --> 00:46:35.815
This is almost the end. I'm doing some wrinkles here,

494
00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.785
but that's really details which we're going to add in later.

495
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.651
Right now, we have the overall shapes in there,

496
00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:49.025
the overall lines that the topology has to follow.

497
00:46:50.249 --> 00:46:53.447
Then we can just dive into Retopology right away,

498
00:46:53.472 --> 00:46:58.289
and later, have more time for Sculpting details

499
00:46:58.325 --> 00:47:01.131
and adding a little bit more interest.
